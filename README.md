## 1. mfiles

* __info_params.m__ is used by all the MATLAB scripts to specify parameters used for creating figures

* __The scripts MS_fig*.m__ are used to generate Figures 1 to 9 in the paper's main text

* __The scripts MS_figS*.m__ are used to generate Figures S1 to S6 in the supplementary information

* __fun*.m__ self-defined functions

* __set_wAO_map.m__ subroutine to create the western Arctic Ocean map frame

* __cbarrow.m__ subroutine to add pointy ends to colorbar

## 2. MSdata
* All the data and color scheme used for figure generation

## 3. MSfig
* Manuscript figures produced by this package
